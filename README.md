<h1>Problem Statement</h1>
<p>Traffic congestion is a major urban challenge that affects mobility, safety, and the environment. It leads to increased fuel consumption, which not only costs more but also causes more air pollution. Long commutes in heavy traffic can be incredibly stressful, too, affecting both mental and physical health. Itâ€™s like a domino effect of negativity.
The ability to accurately predict traffic flow at intersections is crucial for effective traffic management, signal control, and urban planning. However, traditional traffic prediction methods, such as statistical analysis and simple machine learning models, often fall short in capturing the complex spatial and temporal dependencies that characterize urban traffic systems. </p>
<h1>Solution</h1>

<p>The Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (T-GCN) predicts traffic flow at multiple intersections by integrating a Graph Attention Layer and an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network. The Graph Attention Layer utilizes an adjacency matrix to learn spatial relationships among intersections, allowing the model to prioritize the most impactful neighboring nodes. Meanwhile, the LSTM captures temporal patterns in historical traffic data. This combination enables the T-GCN to effectively model how traffic conditions change over time and across locations, resulting in more accurate traffic volume predictions.</p>
